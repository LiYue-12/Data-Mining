# Data-Mining
Assignments for Data mining course
There are three assignments for the Data Mining course. 

Assignment 01:
Task: analyze dataset “Student Performance”. The objective is to explain the final grade (G3) in Math course in terms of the provided attributes.
1. Read the data description.Check if there is missing value.Identify and report response variable and predictors (also called   explanatory variables or features). Report the numerical variables and categorical variables in the dataset.

2. Explore the dataset,and generate both statistical and graphical summary. To simplify the task, only consider the following 10 variables in this exploration: age, address, Pstatus, activities, higher, internet, absences, G1, G2, G3.

3. Apply regression analysis on the data. Evaluate the model as well as the impact of different predictors.


Assignment 02:
analyze dataset Pokemon.csv. The objective is to predict the binary target variable Total (> 500 or not).
Apply different classification techniques (incl. logistic regression, kNN, Naive Bayesian, decision tree, SVM, and Ensemble methods) on this dataset. Use all available predictors in your models.

Assignment 03:
Task a: analyze the data “stock price”. The objective of the analysis is to group stocks together if they have similar trends in price variance.

Task b:analyze US Senator Roll Call Data. The objective is to identify and visualize the clustering patterns of senators’ voting activities.
